# hello-world
Learning how to use git.
I'm going to store my scripts here. Feel free to add on or use them.

Use them at your own risk. I'm not liable for anything dumb you do. 
You can copy them, modify them, eat them, I don't care. They're 
simple scripts. If you want to modify it, fork it, make changes, and 
pull request it.
